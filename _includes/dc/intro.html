<p>
  This workshop is inspired by the format of <a href="{{site.carpentries_site}}">The Carpentries</a>-type
  workshops. It combines lessons drawn from <a href="{{site.dc_site}}">Data
  Carpentry</a>, <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>,
  and the <a
  href="https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum">Reproducible
  Science Curriculum</a> (in particular from the Python-based
  <a href="https://reproducible-science-curriculum.github.io/workshop-RR-Jupyter/">Reproducible Science using Jupyter Notebooks</a> workshop
  curriculum). The total length of instruction is three days rather
  than the usual two, but spread out over four days (the second and
  fourth day are half days). As for regular Carpentries workshops,
  this course will be highly interactive and hands-on. Participants
  will use their own laptops throughout the course, and are encouraged
  to help one another.

<p>
  The Carpentries develops and
  teaches workshops on the foundational coding and data skills needed to conduct
  research. Its target audience is researchers worldwide, including those who have little to no prior computational experience.
