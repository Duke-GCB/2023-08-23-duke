  <h3>Git</h3>
  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/">supported
    web browser</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will need an account at <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>
    for parts of the Git lesson. Basic GitHub accounts are free. We encourage
    you to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.
    Please consider what personal information you'd like to reveal. For
    example, you may want to review these

          Git should be installed on your computer as part of your Bash
          install (see the
          <a href="#shell">Shell installation instructions</a>).

          <strong>For macOS</strong>, in recent versions git comes as part of the Xcode
          installation. If you have installed Xcode, you will likely also have git installed.
          If you have not installed Xcode, invoking git at the command line will usually prompt
          you to install Xcode. To check, open Terminal and type <code>git --version</code> at the shell prompt.
          If this prints out version information, you should be good to go. If instead this prompts you to install
          Xcode, follow the instructions and install Xcode. When finished, try the same command
          again. It should print out the git version information now.
        </p>
        <p>If you are on an older version of macOS, or if installing Xcode doesn't succeed
          in providing the git command, you can install Git for Mac
          by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks" installer from
          <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">this list</a>.
          Because this installer is not signed by the developer, you may have to
          right click (control click) on the .pkg file, click Open, and click
          Open on the pop up window.
          After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
          as Git is a command line program.
          <strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)</strong> use the
          most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard"
          <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">available here</a>.

          If Git is not already available on your machine you can try to
          install it via your distro's package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu run
          <code>sudo apt-get install git</code> and for Fedora run
          <code>sudo dnf install git</code>.
